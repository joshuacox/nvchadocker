# nvchaDocker

Want to try  out nvchad without messing with your existing nvim config?

```
./build && ./nvchad /tmp/testfile
```

# Install

Do you want to install a bit more permanently?

```
sudo make install
```

This will build the docker image locally, and then place the nvchad file in `/usr/local/bin`
